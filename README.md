## User Instruction
### Leader's Physical Environment Scanning Instruction
1. Launch "PhotonSceneUnderstanding2021.3.10" app in your HoloLens 2 (Please be sure to follow [HoloLens 2 Leader Package Installation](#hololens-2-leaderfollower-package-installation))
    - (If you are a Follower launching the app, the Room2XR system will automatically connect to the existing Leader)
3. Once connected to the Room2XR-Python server, press "Detail-Medium" in "WORLD MESH DETAIL LEVEL" on the control panel (a button-pressed sound will be generated if you successfully press it)
4. Press "World mesh" on the control panel to initialize the first update (first column, fourth row)
5. A virtual environment will be generated in your HoloLens 2 view, aligning with your physical environment, and automatically sent to other connected Followers.
### Leader's Environment Update Options
1. Manually press the "Update scene" button on the control panel (third column, second row) on demand
2. Toggle the "Auto update" button on the control panel (first column, first row) to enable auto-update every 5 seconds

### Leader/Follower Switching in Unity Editor (HoloLens 2 Version Only)
1. Go to the "Hierarchy" tab, find "TestConnection" GameObject
